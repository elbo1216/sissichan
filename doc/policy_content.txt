Please be advised that an inquiry does not secure your date. A wedding date is guaranteed via deposit if and only if your requested date is available and you have made the final decision to book by paying a non-refundable and non-transferable $100 deposit, which will be credited towards your final balance. Only after your deposit is received will you be guaranteed your desired date. After your deposit is received, you will be sent an invoice outlining the final headcount for your event, the services requested, and the final balance due. The remaining balance will be due the day of the wedding and must be paid in cash. A minimum of $200 worth of services requested for the day of the event is required to book. The final decision to book can be made with or without having had a trial. Booking a trial is optional but if you do decide to book such an appointment, the cost of the trial is due the same day the services are rendered.
